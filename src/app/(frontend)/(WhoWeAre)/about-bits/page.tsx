                NairoBits Trust is a Kenyan non-profit that leverages ICT to
                empower disadvantaged youth from the informal settlements of
                Nairobi. We offer alternative higher education programs that
                unlock careers in tech through digital skills training and
                professional integration with the labor market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our programming is based on a two pronged strategic approach
                i.e. Enhancing the capacity of underserved youth to increase
                their readiness for them to make gainful advantage of the
                digital age and; Promoting the creation of opportunities and
                utilization of available ones in the ICT sub-sector.
              </p>
              <p>
                These strategic approaches are the backbone of our programs
                ranging across technical skills on digital literacy, acumen
                building and creating wholesome subsector change through
                advocacy on the digital divide across marginalized groups.

                NairoBits started in 1999, when Emer Beamer, Ineke Aquarius and
                Hester Ezra discussed their aspirations to start up a web design
                institute in Nairobi for disadvantaged young people, motivated
                to share their skills as multimedia designers and offer chances
                to the youth in a time where the ICT space in Africa was
                evolving and largely untapped on the education front. Their
                mission was to change the lives of the youth by building their
                skills and changing their mindset, from vulnerable to empowered
                people who could earn a living and uplift their communities as a
                result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our first graduating class consisted of 20 students, who by the
                end of two months had made their own websites with self made
                photos of their city,stories, self portraits and had taken part
                in an online exchange with Dutch students. The works made were
                exhibited in the National Museum of Kenya, the first digital
                exhibition to ever take place at the museum. This resulted in a
                number of media articles and appearances.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ground and launch the project, we institutionalized a new
                organizational approach and educational method based on
                creativity leading to employability and success in the ICT
                sector, supported by our mandate to unlock the potential of the
                targeted youth to improve their socio-economic well-being by
                building and enhancing relevant inter-personal and professional
                skills through entrepreneurship, life-skills and sexual and
                reproductive health rights (SRHR), by effectively educating and
                empowering them.

                  As a co-founder of Nairobits, I wanted to share my abilities
                  in order to give others a chance to make a better life for
                  themselves. To date I am so proud of all that has been
                  achieved, the thousands of lives touched, the opportunities
                  created and the spirit of giving back I see in the alumni
